## Please read
This pipeline was constructed using `kallisto` and `bustools` whilst the Patcher lab was rolling out `kb-python`. It may serve as a useful tool for nextflow scripting, but otherwise the pipelines have not been tested thoroughly. 

I cannot recommend using this pipeline for an analysis. 

If you have read this far, I would suggest contacting Sarah Ennis (https://github.com/Sarah145) whose expertise is scRNA-Seq for a collaboration :).
